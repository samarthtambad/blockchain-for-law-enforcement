# blockchain-for-law-enforcement
Create a system illustrating the utility of Blockchain to maintain criminal case records on an immutable ledger by the police departments. The evidence collected against a criminal (except any physical form of the evidence) that has been added onto the ledger can be admissible by the Court of Law during criminal proceedings.

## Benefits
1. A central database that could be modified by a hacker or a person with access/power but not a distributed ledger.
2. Everyone involved is accountable as chain of events is available. Any lapse of duty such as improper documentation, loss of evidence, etc can be determined and corrected.
3. Courts can be granted permission to invoke queries relating to fetching the evidence for a particular case.
